"""
Tier-2 differential decode against Calibre's upstream `kfxlib` (#50).

The synthetic golden corpus (#48) is decoded by two parsers:
  1. Our vendored subset `kfxgen.kfxlib_minimal`.
  2. The full upstream `kfxlib` extracted from Calibre's `KFX Input.zip`
     plugin (vendored in `tests/fixtures/vendor/kfx_input_plugin.zip`).

The two parsers share their pre-fork ancestry (both descend from
jhowell's kfxlib) but have evolved separately — divergence between
them surfaces generation bugs that one decoder happens to accept and
the other rejects. This is the council brief's "independent provenance"
oracle, complementing tier-3 (golden bytes) and tier-1 (in-process
invariants).

What this test deliberately tolerates:
    Upstream `kfxlib` emits warnings against the shipping generator's
    output that don't break Kindle on real devices —
    `position_id content extra at idx=N`, `location_map failed to
    locate eid 10000+`, `Feature/content mismatch: reflow-section-size`,
    etc. These predate this PR and represent parser-disagreement on
    format choices the device verifies as correct. Failing on them
    would block every CI run from day one with no actionable signal.
    A separate follow-up may tighten the warning-count budget once
    the legitimate device-verified noise floor is characterized.

What this test asserts:
    - Upstream `kfxlib.YJ_Book.decode_book()` does not raise.
    - The fragment-type set from upstream is a *subset* of the set
      from `kfxlib_minimal`. The reverse direction is intentionally
      not asserted: upstream's `decode_book()` runs a semantic pass
      that drops unreferenced fragments (e.g. `content_1`/`s0_h`
      after cover-chapter insertion), and those legitimately appear
      only in our raw decode. The catch-target is "upstream sees a
      type minimal misses" — that means our decoder has a gap.
    - Critical fragment types (`$490`, `$259`, `$260`, `$265`) are
      present in upstream's output. Catches "fragment got dropped
      silently" regressions.
